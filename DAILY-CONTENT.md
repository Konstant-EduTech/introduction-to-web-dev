### *Day 1: What is a Website & HTML Basics*

---

#### *Objective*:
By the end of Day 1, students will understand the basic structure of an HTML document and be able to create a simple webpage with a title and paragraph.

#### *Lesson Content*:

1. *Introduction to Websites*:
    - *Concept*: A website is a collection of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) stored on a web server and accessed via a browser.
    - *Analogy: Think of a website like a book. The **browser* is the book reader, and the *server* is the library where the books (webpages) are stored. 
    - *Key Takeaways*: 
        - The web works by sending requests from the browser to a server and getting HTML files in return.
        - These files are then interpreted and displayed by the browser.

2. *What is HTML?*:
    - *Concept*: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the structure or skeleton of a webpage. It's used to create content like text, images, and links.
    - *Tags and Structure*:
        - HTML uses *tags* (e.g., <html>, <body>, <h1>) to define elements.
        - Every HTML file starts with <!DOCTYPE html> and is structured like this:
            html
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
              <head>
                <title>Page Title</title>
              </head>
              <body>
                <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
                <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
              </body>
            </html>
            
    - *Hands-On Example*: 
        1. Open a text editor (Notepad or VS Code).
        2. Type the basic HTML structure (as shown above).
        3. Save the file as index.html and open it in a browser.

3. *Creating Your First Webpage*:
    - *Activity*: 
        - Add a title and heading using the <title>, <h1>, and <p> tags.
        - Have students change the text and reload the webpage to see how the HTML code reflects on the browser.
    - *Example*: 
        html
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>My First Webpage</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
            <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
          </body>
        </html>
        
    - *Goal*: Ensure students understand how HTML code corresponds to visible content in the browser.

#### *Homework/Practice*:
- Ask students to create a simple webpage that says “Hello, World!” with their name and favorite hobby.

### *Day 2: Understanding HTML Elements*

---

#### *Objective*:
By the end of Day 2, students will know how to use basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and links.

#### *Lesson Content*:

1. *Basic HTML Tags*:
    - *Concept: HTML uses **tags* to define elements. Most elements have an opening tag (e.g., <h1>) and a closing tag (e.g., </h1>).
    - *Key Tags*:
        - *Headings*: <h1> to <h6> define different levels of headings.
        - *Paragraphs*: <p> defines paragraphs.
        - *Links*: <a> creates hyperlinks to other pages or websites.

2. *Adding Links and Text*:
    - *Example*: Create a basic page with headings, paragraphs, and a link to a website.
        html
        <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph of text that explains who I am.</p>
        <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit my favorite website</a>
        
    - *Explanation*:
        - The <a> tag is used to create a hyperlink. The href attribute tells the browser where the link will take the user.
        - Instruct students to experiment with different headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) and add paragraphs with personal information.

3. *Activity*: 
    - Have students create a page with at least 3 different headings, a paragraph about themselves, and a link to their favorite website.
    - *Goal*: Understand the hierarchy of headings and how hyperlinks work in HTML.

#### *Homework/Practice*:
- Ask students to create a page with their name as the heading, a paragraph describing their favorite food, and a link to a restaurant they like.

---

### *Day 3: Adding Lists and Images*

---

#### *Objective*:
By the end of Day 3, students will know how to create ordered and unordered lists, as well as how to embed images on their webpage.

#### *Lesson Content*:

1. *Creating Lists in HTML*:
    - *Concept*: Lists are used to group related content, either as ordered (<ol>) or unordered (<ul>) lists.
    - *Unordered List* Example:
        html
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        
    - *Ordered List* Example:
        html
        <ol>
          <li>Wake up</li>
          <li>Brush your teeth</li>
          <li>Go to work</li>
        </ol>
        
    - *Activity*: Have students create a page with a list of their top 3 favorite hobbies, one using <ul> and one using <ol>.

2. *Adding Images*:
    - *Concept*: The <img> tag is used to display images. The src attribute points to the image file, and the alt attribute provides alternate text for accessibility.
    - *Example*:
        html
        <img src="https://www.example.com/image.jpg" alt="An example image">
        
    - *Explanation*: Students should understand that the src (source) points to where the image is located, which can be a URL or a file on their computer.
    - *Activity*: Have students find an image online and embed it on their webpage using the <img> tag.

#### *Homework/Practice*:
- Ask students to create a webpage with an unordered list of their favorite movies and an embedded image related to one of the movies.

### *Day 4: Structuring Content with Divs and Spans*

---

#### *Objective*:
By the end of Day 4, students will be able to structure their HTML content into sections using <div> and style inline text with <span>.

#### *Lesson Content*:

1. **Using <div> to Group Content**:
    - *Concept*: The <div> tag is used to group sections of a webpage together. It’s a block-level element, meaning it takes up the entire width of its container.
    - *Example*:
        html
        <div>
          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>This is a section about me.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>My Projects</h2>
          <p>This is a section about my projects.</p>
        </div>
        
    - *Activity*: Have students wrap their headings and paragraphs in <div> tags to create separate sections on their webpage.

2. **Using <span> for Inline Styling**:
    - *Concept*: The <span> tag is used to style a specific part of text without affecting the entire block. It’s an inline element, so it doesn’t start a new line.
    - *Example*:
        html
        <p>This is <span style="color: red;">important</span> text.</p>
        
    - *Activity*: Ask students to highlight a word or sentence in their text using the <span> tag and inline styling.

#### *Homework/Practice*:
- Ask students to organize their webpage into sections using <div> and style specific words using <span>.

### **Day 6: Introduction to CSS**

---

#### **Objective**:
By the end of Day 6, students will understand how CSS works with HTML and will be able to apply basic inline styles to modify text and backgrounds.

#### **Lesson Content**:

1. **What is CSS?**:
    - **Concept**: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the look and feel of a webpage. It works by styling HTML elements.
    - **CSS Syntax**: CSS is written in a **selector {property: value;}** format. The selector identifies the HTML element, and the property-value pair defines the style.
    - **Example**:
        html
        <h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">Hello, World!</h1>
        
    - **Explanation**: 
      - The `<h1>` tag is selected, and CSS styles are applied directly with the `style` attribute. This is called **inline CSS**.
      - In this example, `color: blue;` changes the text color, and `font-size: 24px;` increases the font size.

2. **Inline CSS Basics**:
    - **Activity**: Ask students to add some inline styles to their portfolio by:
        - Changing the color of headings.
        - Adjusting the font size of paragraphs.
        - Changing the background color of a section.

3. **Linking External CSS** (Introduction):
    - **Concept**: Inline styles are useful for quick changes, but CSS can also be written externally to style multiple pages consistently. This will be introduced in more detail on Day 7.
    - **Explanation**: For now, demonstrate how students will eventually link an external stylesheet by using:
        html
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
        
    - **Activity**: For Day 6, students should focus only on inline CSS.

4. **Outcome**: 
    - By the end of Day 6, students will know how to apply basic inline styles to control the color, font size, and backgrounds of their webpage.

#### **Homework/Practice**:
- Ask students to modify their portfolio using inline CSS to make the headings colorful, adjust the size of text, and experiment with different background colors for each section.

### **Day 7: CSS Basics – Colors, Fonts, and Text Alignment**

---

#### **Objective**:
By the end of Day 7, students will know how to apply basic CSS styles to control text appearance, including colors, fonts, and text alignment.

#### **Lesson Content**:

1. **Changing Text Colors**:
    - **Concept**: Use the `color` property in CSS to change text colors.
    - **Example**:
        html
        <h1 style="color: red;">Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        
    - **Explanation**: Color names or hex codes can be used to apply different colors.
        - Example hex code: `#ff5733` for a specific shade of orange.

2. **Setting Fonts and Font Sizes**:
    - **Concept**: Use `font-family` to change the text font, and `font-size` to change the size of the text.
    - **Example**:
        html
        <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;">This is a paragraph in Arial font.</p>
        
    - **Explanation**:
        - `font-family` allows you to specify the font type.
        - `font-size` controls how large the text appears.

3. **Text Alignment**:
    - **Concept**: Use `text-align` to control how text is positioned within its container.
    - **Example**:
        html
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Centered Heading</h1>
        
    - **Explanation**: Values like `left`, `right`, and `center` can be used to align text.

4. **Activity**:
    - Have students:
        1. Change the color of the headings and paragraphs.
        2. Set a different font for the body text of the webpage.
        3. Align the headings to the center of the page.

5. **Outcome**: 
    - By the end of Day 7, students will be able to apply styles for colors, fonts, and alignment to improve the appearance of their portfolio.

#### **Homework/Practice**:
- Ask students to style their portfolio so that the headings are centered, the text color and fonts are consistent, and the layout feels more professional.

### **Day 8: CSS Box Model – Margins, Padding, and Borders**

---

#### **Objective**:
By the end of Day 8, students will understand the CSS box model and how to use margins, padding, and borders to control spacing and layout.

#### **Lesson Content**:

1. **Understanding the CSS Box Model**:
    - **Concept**: Every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box with the following layers:
        1. **Content** (text or image).
        2. **Padding** (space between the content and the border).
        3. **Border** (the outline around the padding).
        4. **Margin** (space outside the border).
    - **Visual Representation**: Show a diagram to explain how padding, borders, and margins work.

2. **Applying Padding and Borders**:
    - **Example**:
        html
        <div style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px;">
          <p>This content has padding and a border.</p>
        </div>
        
    - **Explanation**: 
        - `padding` adds space between the content and the border.
        - `border` can be styled with width, color, and type (e.g., `solid`, `dashed`).

3. **Controlling Margins**:
    - **Concept**: `margin` is the space outside the border that separates elements.
    - **Example**:
        html
        <div style="margin: 20px;">
          <p>This content has a margin around it.</p>
        </div>
        ```

4. *Activity*:
    - Have students:
        1. Add borders to their sections.
        2. Add padding inside the sections to create space between the content and the border.
        3. Add margins between the different sections of their portfolio to space them out.

5. *Outcome*: 
    - By the end of Day 8, students will understand how the CSS box model works and will be able to use padding, borders, and margins to control the layout of their webpage.

#### *Homework/Practice*:
- Ask students to apply padding, margins, and borders to the sections of their portfolio to give the page a clean, well-spaced layout.

### **Day 9: Styling Layouts with Divs**

---

#### **Objective**:
By the end of Day 9, students will be able to structure a webpage using `<div>` elements and CSS for basic layout, including creating columns and sections.

#### **Lesson Content**:

1. **Structuring Webpages with Divs**:
    - **Concept**: Use `<div>` elements as containers to organize content. Divs can be styled using CSS to create different sections on the webpage.
    - **Example**:
        ```html
        <div style="background-color: lightgrey; padding: 20px;">
          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>This is a section about me.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background-color: white; padding: 20px;">
          <h2>My Projects</h2>
          <p>This is a section about my projects.</p>
        </div>
        ```

2. **Creating a Two-Column Layout**:
    - **Concept**: Use CSS to float divs side by side, creating columns.
    - **Example**:
        ```html
        <div style="width: 50%; float: left;">
          <h2>Column 1</h2>
          <p>This is content for the first column.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="width: 50%; float: right;">
          <h2>Column 2</h2>
          <p>This is content for the second column.</p>
        </div>
        ```
    - **Explanation**: `float` is used to position divs next to each other, and `width` determines the size of each column.

3. **Activity**:
    - Have students:
        1. Create two-column sections in their portfolio, such as a bio on one side and a project list on the other.
        2. Experiment with different background colors and padding to make the columns visually distinct.

4. **Outcome**: 
    - By the end of Day 9, students will be able to create basic layouts using `<div>` elements and CSS to organize content into columns and sections.

          font-size: 16px;
          line-height: 1.6;
        }
        ```
    - **Explanation**: Define global styles (for body, headings, and paragraphs) to ensure consistency across the site.

2. **Styling the Header and Footer**:
    - **Concept**: Use CSS to style the header and footer of the page to make it visually appealing and clear.
    - **Example**:
        ```html
